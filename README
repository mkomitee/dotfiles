The Bexec plugin allows the user to execute the current buffer if it contains a script with a shebang (#!/path/to/interpreter) on the first line or if the default interpreter for the script's type is known by Bexec. The output of the script will be grabbed and displayed in a separate buffer.

It can be used to execute, for instance, Shell, PHP, PERL, Python or SQL scripts from within Vim.
