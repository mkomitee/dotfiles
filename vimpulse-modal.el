;;;; Modal keybinding functions

;; Functions for making state bindings (modal bindings).
;;
;; Global state bindings (seen in all buffers):
;;     `vimpulse-global-set-key', `vimpulse-map', `vimpulse-imap',
;;     `vimpulse-vmap', `vimpulse-omap'
;; Buffer-local state bindings (seen only in the current buffer):
;;     `vimpulse-local-set-key', `vimpulse-map-local',
;;     `vimpulse-imap-local', `vimpulse-vmap-local',
;;     `vimpulse-omap-local'
;; State bindings for Emacs modes (minor and major):
;;     `vimpulse-define-key'
;;
;; `vimpulse-map' etc. mimic Vim's :map, :imap, :vmap and :omap
;; commands; `vimpulse-map-local' etc. are similar, but buffer-local.
;;
;; `vimpulse-define-key' associates state bindings with an Emacs mode,
;; and is useful for grouping bindings:
;;
;;     (define-minor-mode foo-mode)
;;     (vimpulse-define-key 'foo-mode 'vi-state "a" 'bar)
;;     (vimpulse-define-key 'foo-mode 'visual-state "b" 'baz)
;;
;; These bindings are only seen in buffers where foo-mode is enabled.
;; You can also augment existing modes, of course.
;;
;; Vimpulse provides "careful" bindings, which are bindings that can
;; be safely stacked on top of pre-existing bindings. They can be made
;; with `vimpulse-make-careful-binding' (see its docstring for more
;; details), or by passing a non-nil value for the CAREFUL argument of
;; `vimpulse-global-set-key', `vimpulse-local-set-key' or
;; `vimpulse-define-key'. `vimpulse-map' etc. are always careful.

  (keymap key def &optional dont-list define-func)
  "Carefully bind KEY to DEF in KEYMAP.
\"Carefully\" means that if a subset of the key sequence is already
bound, a default binding is made so that the new binding won't
overwrite the old. E.g., if we want to carefully bind \"A B C\" to
`foo', and \"A B\" is already bound to `bar', the end result is

    \"A B C\"   => `foo'
    \"A B <t>\" => `bar'

Thus, \"A B C\" runs `foo', while \"A B\" + any key other than \"C\"
defaults to `bar'. To remove a careful binding, bind it to nil.

The default binding gets listed in `vimpulse-careful-alist', so
that, with regard to command loop variables, it appears exactly
the same as the binding it replaced. In the example above, `bar'
will see a `last-command-event' of \"B\", and will automatically
obtain the last key by calling `read-char'. To make a regular
default binding, use DONT-LIST. DEFINE-FUNC specifies a function
to be used in place of `define-key'.

NOTE: If the original binding \"A B\" is not stored in KEYMAP,
but in some other map which is active only in a certain
state (say, Insert mode), this function can detect that binding
only if called in the same state. The functions `vimpulse-map',
`vimpulse-imap' and `vimpulse-vmap' take care of this."
