;;; Commentary:

;; Basic steps to setup:
;;
;;   1. In your .emacs file:
;;        (add-to-list 'load-path "/dir/to/yasnippet.el")
;;        (require 'yasnippet)
;;   2. Place the `snippets' directory somewhere.  E.g: ~/.emacs.d/snippets
;;   3. In your .emacs file
;;        (setq yas/root-directory "~/.emacs/snippets")
;;        (yas/load-directory yas/root-directory)
;;   4. To enable the YASnippet menu and tab-trigger expansion
;;        M-x yas/minor-mode
;;   5. To globally enable the minor mode in *all* buffers
;;        M-x yas/global-mode
;;
;;   Steps 4. and 5. are optional, you don't have to use the minor
;;   mode to use YASnippet.
;;
;;   Interesting variables are:
;;
;;       `yas/root-directory'
;;
;;           The directory where user-created snippets are to be
;;           stored. Can also be a list of directories that
;;           `yas/reload-all' will use for bulk-reloading snippets. In
;;           that case the first directory the default for storing new
;;           snippets.
;;
;;       `yas/mode-symbol'
;;
;;           A local variable that you can set in a hook to override
;;           snippet-lookup based on major mode. It is a a symbol (or
;;           list of symbols) that correspond to subdirectories of
;;           `yas/root-directory' and is used for deciding which
;;           snippets to consider for the active buffer.
;;
;;   Major commands are:
;;
;;       M-x yas/expand
;;
;;           Try to expand snippets before point.  In `yas/minor-mode',
;;           this is bound to `yas/trigger-key' which you can customize.
;;
;;       M-x yas/load-directory
;;
;;           Prompts you for a directory hierarchy of snippets to load.
;;
;;       M-x yas/insert-snippet
;;
;;           Prompts you for possible snippet expansion if that is
;;           possible according to buffer-local and snippet-local
;;           expansion conditions.  With prefix argument, ignore these
;;           conditions.
;;
;;       M-x yas/find-snippets
;;
;;           Lets you find the snippet files in the correct
;;           subdirectory of `yas/root-directory', according to the
;;           active major mode (if it exists) like
;;           `find-file-other-window'.
;;
;;       M-x yas/visit-snippet-file
;;
;;           Prompts you for possible snippet expansions like
;;           `yas/insert-snippet', but instead of expanding it, takes
;;           you directly to the snippet definition's file, if it
;;           exists.
;;
;;       M-x yas/new-snippet
;;
;;           Lets you create a new snippet file in the correct
;;           subdirectory of `yas/root-directory', according to the
;;           active major mode.
;;
;;       M-x yas/load-snippet-buffer
;;
;;           When editing a snippet, this loads the snippet.  This is
;;           bound to "C-c C-c" while in the `snippet-mode' editing
;;           mode.
;;
;;       M-x yas/tryout-snippet
;;
;;           When editing a snippet, this opens a new empty buffer,
;;           sets it to the appropriate major mode and inserts the
;;           snippet there, so you can see what it looks like.  This is
;;           bound to "C-c C-t" while in `snippet-mode'.
;;
;;   The `dropdown-list.el' extension is bundled with YASnippet, you
;;   can optionally use it the preferred "prompting method", puting in
;;   your .emacs file, for example:
;;
;;       (require 'dropdown-list)
;;       (setq yas/prompt-functions '(yas/dropdown-prompt
;;                                    yas/ido-prompt
;;                                    yas/completing-prompt))
;;
;;   Also check out the customization group
;;
;;        M-x customize-group RET yasnippet RET
;;
;;   If you use the customization group to set variables
;;   `yas/root-directory' or `yas/global-mode', make sure the path to
;;   "yasnippet.el" is present in the `load-path' *before* the
;;   `custom-set-variables' is executed in your .emacs file.
