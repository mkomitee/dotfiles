{{{
  Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
   In the forests of the night,
    What immortal hand or eye
     Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
  In what distant deeps or skies
   Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
    On what wings dare he aspire?
     What the hand dare sieze the fire?

= Blockquotes =
    This would be a blockquote in vimwiki. It is not highlighted in vim but
    could be styled by css in html. Blockquotes are usually used to quote a
    long piece of text from another source. The trick is indenting all the
    text with 4 or more spaces.
