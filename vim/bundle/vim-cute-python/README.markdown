Use unicode characters for some Python operators and built-in functions, turning
the following:

```python
    map (lambda x: x, [1,2,3])

    def foo(e, a):
        if e in [1,2,3] and not a:
            return math.sqrt(math.pi)
        else:
            return sum([1,2,3])
```

into

```python
    map (λ x: x, [1,2,3])

    def foo(e, a):
        if e ∈ [1,2,3] ∧ ¬a:
            return √(π)
        else:
            return ∑([1,2,3])
```

*This does not – at any point — alter your source code*. It simply uses Vim's
“conceal” feature to “hide” **in** behind **∈**, etc. Whenever the cursor is at
a line with concealed text, the text will be expanded.

Vim ≥ 7.3 is required.

To install, simply put python.vim in ~/.vim/after/syntax.
