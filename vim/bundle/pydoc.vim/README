pydoc.vim integrates pythons documentation system into vim. If you use vim and python, you want to use it :-).

NOTE: Right now pydoc.vim is a ftplugin, which is new. If that works for everyone, I will update the docs and release a new version on vim.org. Before I do that, I wait for some feedback here in github.
