;;; Commentary:

;; Yeah, I am rolling my own framework. The pre-existing frameworks
;; all had their good points, but none offered every feature I needed.
;; Plus it's more fun this way. :)
;;
;; The framework currently provides assertions, tests, suites,
;; fixtures, mocks and stubs.

;;; Tests

;; A simple test may look like this:
;;
;;     (deftest test-foo
;;       (assert (= (+ 2 2) 4))
;;       (assert (= (* 3 3) 9))
;;       (assert (= (% 4 2) 0)))
;;
;; This checks that 2 + 2 = 4, that 3 * 3 = 9, and that 4 % 2 = 0.
;; (If it isn't, something is seriously wrong!) To run the test:
;;
;;     (test-foo)    ; `M-x test-foo' interactively
;;
;; Alternatively, specify `:run t' when defining the test to run the test
;; every time the `deftest' form is evaluated:
;;
;;     (deftest test-foo
;;       :run t
;;       (assert (= (+ 2 2) 4))
;;       (assert (= (* 3 3) 9))
;;       (assert (= (% 4 2) 0)))
;;
;; Let's simplify it a bit. The various `assert-' forms accept multiple
;; (sets of) arguments, similarly to, e.g., `setq':
;;
;;     (deftest test-foo
;;       :run t
;;       (assert
;;         (= (+ 2 2) 4)
;;         (= (* 3 3) 9)
;;         (= (% 4 2) 0)))
;;
;; This is Lisp, after all! Furthermore, `assert-=' removes the
;; `=' noise (and makes the failure report more specific):
;;
;;     (deftest test-foo
;;       :run t
;;       (assert-=
;;         (+ 2 2) 4
;;         (* 3 3) 9
;;         (% 4 2) 0))
;;
;; At this point it's advisable to add some documentation. Tests as
;; well as assertions can have docstrings:
;;
;;     (deftest test-foo
;;       "Example test."
;;       :run t
;;       (assert-=
;;         "Elementary truths."
;;         (+ 2 2) 4
;;         (* 3 3) 9
;;         (% 4 2) 0))
;;
;; If the test fails, the first line of the string shows up in the report.
;;
;; NOTE: xUnit frameworks often use "Yoda order", e.g.,
;; "assertEquals(4, 2 + 2);", where the expected value comes first.
;; Here, however, the expected value follows the actual. (Although
;; `=' is symmetrical, the failure reports depend on the order.)
;;
;; NOTE 2: `assert' only accepts multiple arguments inside `deftest'.
;; Outside `deftest' it's a different macro (defined by cl.el).
;;
;; NOTE 3: it's a good idea to name tests with a prefix, e.g.,
;; "test-". This avoids accidently overwriting other functions.

;;; Test suites

;; Tests can be grouped into suites with `defsuite'. The most
;; straightforward way is to just wrap it around them:
;;
;;     (defsuite test-foo-suite
;;       "Example suite."
;;       :run t
;;       (deftest test-foo
;;         "Example test."
;;         (assert-=
;;           "Elementary truth."
;;           (+ 2 2) 4))
;;       (deftest test-bar
;;         "Another example test."
;;         (assert-=
;;           "More elementary truth."
;;           (* 3 3) 9)))
;;
;; Like tests, the suite is executed with (test-foo-suite),
;; `M-x test-foo-suite' or `:run t' in the definition. Suites can also
;; have docstrings. For brevity, "deftest" can be omitted:
;;
;;     (defsuite test-foo-suite
;;       "Example suite."
;;       :run t
;;       (test-foo
;;        "Example test."
;;        (assert-=
;;          "Elementary truth."
;;          (+ 2 2) 4))
;;       (test-bar
;;        "Another example test."
;;        (assert-=
;;          "More elementary truth."
;;          (* 3 3) 9)))
;;
;; One can go even further and remove the test names themselves:
;;
;;     (defsuite test-foo-suite
;;       "Example suite."
;;       :run t
;;       ("Example test."
;;        (assert-=
;;          "Elementary truth."
;;          (+ 2 2) 4))
;;       ("Another example test."
;;        (assert-=
;;          "More elementary truth."
;;          (* 3 3) 9)))
;;
;; This might be suitable for small suites, but in general it's better
;; to give each test a name by which they can be called afterwards.
;;
;; A suite can include other suites simply by listing the suite names
;; in its `defsuite' form. Furthermore, `defsuite' forms may be
;; nested. One can also define the test suite first and then add tests
;; and suites to it, using the `:suite' keyword or `add-to-suite':
;;
;;     (defsuite test-foo-suite
;;       "Example suite.")
;;
;;     (deftest test-foo
;;       "Example test."
;;       :suite test-foo-suite
;;       (assert-=
;;         "Elementary truth."
;;         (+ 2 2) 4))
;;
;;     (add-to-suite 'test-foo-suite 'test-bar)
;;
;; NOTE: self-referencing suite definitions should be avoided,
;; although some safeguards exist to prevent infinite loops.

;;; Fixtures

;; Sometimes it's useful to set up and tear down an environment for
;; each test in a suite. This can be done with the :setup and
;; :teardown keyword arguments, which accept a list of expressions to
;; evaluate before and after each test.
;;
;;     (defsuite test-foo-suite
;;       "Example suite."
;;       :setup ((wibble) (wobble))
;;       :teardown ((wubble) (flob))
;;       (test-foo
;;        ...)
;;       (test-bar
;;        ...))
;;
;; However, this may not be enough: what if the setup and teardown
;; need to share variables, or the test should be wrapped in a macro
;; like `save-restriction'? To that end, the more powerful :fixture
;; keyword argument may be used. It accepts a one-argument function
;; which is used to call the test:
;;
;;     (defsuite test-foo-suite
;;       "Example suite."
;;       :fixture (lambda (body)
;;                  (let (foo bar)
;;                    (wibble)
;;                    (wobble)
;;                    (save-restriction
;;                      (funcall body))   ; run test
;;                    (wubble)
;;                    (flob)))
;;       (test-foo
;;        ...)
;;       (test-bar
;;        ...))
;;
;; There's also the :wrap keyword argument, which specifies an
;; around-advice for the whole test, e.g., :wrap ((wobble) ad-do-it).
;; (See `defadvice' for more details.) The arguments are executed in
;; the following order:
;;
;;                  +-------------------+
;;                  |:wrap              |
;;                  |  +--------------+ |
;;                  |  |:setup        | |
;;                  |  |  +---------+ | |
;;                  |  |  |:fixture | | |
;;                  |  |  |  +----+ | | |
;;                  |  |  |  |TEST| | | |
;;                  |  |  |  +----+ | | |
;;                  |  |  +---------+ | |
;;                  |  |:teardown     | |
;;                  |  +--------------+ |
;;                  +-------------------+
;;
;; Any single test may also specify these arguments. In that case, the
;; suite fixtures are wrapped around the test fixtures.
;;
;; NOTE: if defining a function to use as a fixture, make sure it's
;; defined before the tests are run (before the test if using :run t).
;;
;; NOTE 2: :setup, :teardown and :fixture are repeated for each test
;; in the suite, while :wrap is executed once for the whole suite.
;;
;; NOTE 3: a test defined as part of a suite carries with it the
;; suite's fixtures even when called outside the suite. When the test
;; is called by a different suite, that suite's fixtures temporarily
;; override the fixtures inherited from the original suite.

;;; Mocks and stubs

;; Mocks and stubs are temporary stand-ins for other pieces of code.
;; They are useful for disabling (or "stubbing out") external behavior
;; while testing a unit.
;;
;; To stub a function, use `stub':
;;
;;     (deftest test-foo
;;       "Example test."
;;       (stub foo)
;;       (assert-not (foo)))  ; foo returns nil
;;
;; In the rest of the test, any calls to the stubbed function will
;; return nil. To return a different value, specify the stub's body,
;; e.g., (stub foo t).
;;
;; A stub only changes a function's output, not its input: the
;; argument list remains the same. The stub's body may refer to the
;; original arguments. To change a function's input too, use `mock':
;;
;;     (deftest test-foo
;;       "Example test."
;;       (mock foo (arg)
;;         (1+ arg))
;;       (assert-= (foo 1) 2))  ; foo returns 2
;;
;; `mock' specifies a temporary function to assign to `foo' for the
;; duration of the test. Here it increments its argument by one. When
;; the test completes (or fails), all stubs and mocks are released.
;;
;; If the same mock is frequently reused, put it in a fixture or
;; define a function for it and call that function in the test. Just
;; ensure that it is never called outside a test, otherwise it will
;; not be released (unless wrapped in `with-mocks-and-stubs').

;; 2010-09-14: Add `silent-tests' and `logged-tests' variables
;;
;;      By default, tests and suites log their results in the
;;      *Messages* buffer. If `logged-tests' is nil, results are not
;;      logged; if `silent-tests' is t, results are not even echoed.
;;
;;      Exception: if `silent-tests' is t and a test or suite is
;;      called interactively, the result is echoed, but not logged.
;;
;; 2010-09-13: Add DEBUG parameter to tests and suites
;;
;;      This provides verbose output useful on a per-test basis.
;;      Normally, tests are run in "batch mode", where the test code
;;      is wrapped in a protective `condition-case' form. This is
;;      usually what we want, since it doesn't halt code execution
;;      when tests are loaded in .emacs. Thus, if something fails, we
;;      will get a warning, but Emacs will still load to the best of
;;      its ability.
;;
;;      Otherwise, in "debug mode", the debugger is entered on error
;;      and execution is halted. This mode is enabled by running a
;;      test or suite interactively, or by passing t to the DEBUG
;;      parameter, e.g., (test t). The "debug mode" sets
;;      `debug-on-error' to t.
;;
;;      Incidentally, the DEBUG parameter is also used for selecting
;;      among the different "clauses" of a test function. In the
;;      "internal" cases, DEBUG is either `batch' or `debug', and the
;;      test silently returns t if it passes or returns an error
;;      message string if it fails (or it enters the debugger). When
;;      tests are run as part of a suite, they are run in this way.
;;      The suite collects all error messages and presents them to the
;;      user.
;;
;;      In the "user" cases, DEBUG is either nil (the default) or t,
;;      and the test looks for a suite to present it. The test calls a
;;      suite which in turn runs the test "internally". In sketch:
;;
;;      +--------+    +-------------------+    +---------------+
;;      | (test) | => | (suite ... 'test) | => | (test 'batch) |
;;      +--------+    +-------------------+    +---------------+
;;
;;      If DEBUG is nil (the default when called programmatically),
;;      the test is ultimately called in "batch mode". If DEBUG is t
;;      (the default when called interactively), the test is
;;      ultimately called in "debug mode". A :debug keyword argument
;;      may be specified to let a test be called in "debug mode" by
;;      default, but this should be used carefully.
;;
;; 2010-09-03: Fix long-standing compilation issues
;;
;;      To let `defsuite' be wrapped around `deftest', there were two
;;      strategies for making the two "communicate": either at compile
;;      time or at run time. The former was tried first, with partial
;;      results: tests would work uncompiled and the file would
;;      compile without warnings -- but the tests wouldn't work
;;      compiled.
;;
;;      Now, we make the communication happen at run time instead.
;;      The macro expansion of `defsuite' is a `let' form which the
;;      expansion of `deftest', running inside the form, can pick up
;;      on. The tests now compile properly, with (ahem) considerable
;;      speed gains.
;;
;;      We also try to disentangle the confusing relationship between
;;      suites and tests. Since the current suite is always included
;;      in the failure report, suites, not tests, are charged with the
;;      task of reporting failures. A test function consists of two
;;      clauses: either the test will call a suite to run itself (and
;;      report any failure), or it will execute its test code and
;;      return the result. If the test succeeds, the return value is
;;      t; otherwise it is an error message string, which the calling
;;      suite collects and reports.
;;
;;      Any suite can be called to run any test. If a test is not
;;      associated with a suite, it may default to `empty-suite'.
